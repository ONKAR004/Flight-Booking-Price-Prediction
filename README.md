# Flight-Booking-Price-Prediction

**✈️ Overview:**
This project focuses on predicting flight ticket prices using machine learning techniques like **Random Forest Regressor** with accuracy of **93%**. By analyzing various factors such as airline, departure time, duration, and the number of days left before departure, the model helps users estimate flight prices efficiently.

**📂 Dataset:** Contains **300000+** data points, includes key attributes such as: Airline, Flight Class, Date of Journey, Source & Destination, Duration, Total Stops, Days Left Before, Departure, Price (Target variable)

**⚙️ Technologies Used:** Python, Pandas & NumPy for data processing, Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization, Scikit-learn for machine learning, 
Jupyter Notebook for development

**📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
-Frequency of flights per airline and class
-Price variation by airline
-Days left before departure vs price trends

**🎯 Feature Engineering;**
-Label Encoding for categorical variables
-Feature Selection using Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)

**💪 Machine Learning Models**
-Linear Regression 
-Decision Tree Regressor
-Random Forest Regressor **(93% accuracy)**

🚀 Future Improvements

Experiment with advanced models like XGBoost
Deploy the model as a web application
Integrate real-time flight data for dynamic predictions
